# How to use mcd-cli to interact with Kovan deployment of MCD

**This guide works under the [0.2.4 Release](https://changelog.makerdao.com/releases/0.2.4/index.html) of the system.** 

This guide will show how to use the [mcd-cli](https://github.com/makerdao/mcd-cli) to interact with the Kovan deployment of the MCD smart contracts. The guide will showcase how to go through the following stages of the lifecycle of a collateralized debt position (CDP):

 - Opening CDP
 - Depositing collateral tokens (COL1 token)
 - Drawing Dai
 - Paying back Dai
 - Unlocking collateral
 - Closing CDP

The command-line interface mcd-cli will enable you to easily interact with the Multi-Collateral Dai contracts. In the CLI, you can lock assets such as ETH and many other collateral testnet dummy tokens we have added (COL1, COL2, COL3, COL4, COL5), draw Dai against them, check your CDP position, and much more.  

## Installing mcd-cli and seth
**The following link provides you with the necessary instructions to get started with the MCD CLI:**  [https://github.com/makerdao/mcd-cli](https://github.com/makerdao/mcd-cli)  

 - First install  [dapp tools](https://dapp.tools/):

`$ curl https://dapp.tools/install | sh`

 - Then install the  `mcd`  package:

`$ dapp pkg install mcd`

### Setting up variables in seth
Configuring Seth can be done with environment variables or command line options. Environment variables can be generally used in two ways: you can save them in a configuration file named .sethrc in specific locations, like your home folder, or just set them only for the current terminal session. In this guide we will use environment variables with the latter approach for simplicity’s sake, however for ease-of-use in the future, we strongly encourage to save the variables in your project folder. Follow [this example](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/tree/master/src/seth#example-sethrc-file) to do so.

Seth can connect to the Kovan Ethereum testnet through a default remote node provided by Infura, by specifying the `SETH_CHAIN` variable in a terminal or the `.sethrc` file:

`export SETH_CHAIN=kovan`

If you decide to create a new account, an easy method is using the "create new wallet" option in MEW: [https://www.myetherwallet.com/](https://www.myetherwallet.com/). It is also possible to use Parity or Geth to create a new account or you can use an existing keystore file for a Parity or Geth account. You are also going to need to save the password of your keystore file in a plain text file (Never use this keystore file for real ether - saving the password for your keystore file in plain text would be very unsafe for a real account! This also goes for the testnet account!).

Then you have to set up account variables:

    export ETH_KEYSTORE=<path to your keystore folder>
    export ETH_PASSWORD=<path and filename to the text file containing the password for your account e.g: /home/one1up/MakerDAO/415pass >
    export ETH_FROM=<your ethereum account address>
    export MCD_CHAIN=kovan

## Acquiring test tokens

To start using and interacting with the MCD contracts, you will need to get some Kovan ETH, COL1, COL2, COL3, COL4, COL5 and MKR. Please note that MKR holders will eventually confirm the final collateral types through a proposed vote from the Maker Risk Team. Once you have the respective Kovan tokens, you can proceed to the guide below to go through the processes of a CDP lifecycle. This includes locking in some collateral, drawing Dai, paying back the Dai, and then unlocking the collateral.  

In the guide below, everything described above will be performed using the MCD-CLI.

### How to Get Kovan-ETH and K-Collateral Tokens

#### Getting Kovan ETH

There are many sources from which to get Kovan ETH, including:

-   **Standard Faucet**  **Method:**  [https://faucet.kovan.network/](https://faucet.kovan.network/)
    -   This method requires you to log in with your Github account. You then must paste your ETH address in the input box and request the funds.
-   **Gitter Method:**  [https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet](https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet)
    -   This method also requires you to log in with your GitHub or an existing Gitter account. To receive Kovan ETH through this method, join this Gitter Channel (which you also need to cover gas costs for use of the dApps):  [https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet](https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet). Once you join the Gitter Channel, post your ETH address from MetaMask to the main chat. The Kovan faucet will then populate your wallet with the test funds. This could take a couple minutes or a couple of hours, as it is done manually by the channel’s admin.

#### Getting Kovan Collateral Tokens

We have deployed a special faucet that allows you to withdraw testnet collateral tokens that essentially mimic the real tokens that exist on mainnet.  

**K-Collateral Token Faucet Address:** `0xa402e771a4662dcbe661e839a6e8c294d2ce44cf`

**Note:**  You can call the  **gulp(address)**  function on it with  **seth**. The **address** parameter is the address of the COL1 to COL5 collateral types we have added to this deployment.  

**Instructions:**  
In order to receive some tokens of the COL1 type, you must run the following commands in the CLI:

**i. Setting the COL1 address to env variable:**

`$ export COL1A=0xc644e83399f3c0b4011d3dd3c61bc8b1617253e5`

**ii. Setting the Faucet address to env variable:**

`export FAUCET=0xa402e771a4662dcbe661e839a6e8c294d2ce44cf`

**iii. Now, you can call the** **_gulp(address)_** **function:**

`$ seth send $FAUCET 'gulp(address)' $COL1A` 

**iv. Please verify your COL1 balance by running:**

`$ seth --from-wei $(seth --to-dec $(seth call $COL1A 'balanceOf(address)' $ETH_FROM)) eth`   
or   
`mcd --ilk=COL1-A gem balance ext`

**An example of the output you should be viewing when running the above command:**

`50.000000000000000000`

**That’s it! You now have some COL1 k-collateral tokens.**  

**Note:**  If you would like to receive some K-MKR tokens, you would need to replace the  **COL1** token address with the  K-MKR  token address (0x62048f1d8090889f269bc97ee69de731a21273e3) and follow the exact same process as above.
`export MKR=0x62048f1d8090889f269bc97ee69de731a21273e3`

After you have successfully received the Kovan collateral tokens, you can continue on and explore the MCD-CLI.

## CDP Lifecycle Walkthrough

The following instructions will guide you through an example of a CDP’s lifecycle. We will be creating a loan with COL1 type collateral (note that COL1-COL5 collateral types simply simulate ERC-20 tokens) and will then pay it back. Make sure you have set up the env variables outlined above in **Setting up variables in seth** since we will be using those in the following.

**Once set up, you can begin to run through the CDP lifecycle using the commands noted below.**  

For this example, we are going to use the COL1 tokens as the first type of collateral in our CDP. Before proceeding, please check that you have already received some COL1 from the faucet. If you haven’t, please visit the  **‘Getting K Collateral tokens’** section above.  

**Instructions**  

**1. Connect the COL1 tokens into the COL1 adapter. Here, you must change the below value of ’60’ to your own value.**  

**Run:**  
`$ mcd --ilk=COL1-A gem join 60`

**Output Example:**  

    vat 60.000000000000000000 Unlocked collateral (COL1)
    
    ink 0.000000000000000000 Locked collateral (COL1)
    
    ext 0.000000000000000000 External account balance (COL1)

----------

**2. Lock your COL1 collateral tokens and then draw 1 dai from VAT. Again, please don’t forget to change the below value of 60 to your own value.**  

**Run:**

`$ mcd --ilk=COL1-A frob 60 1`

**Example Output:**  

    ilk COL1-A Collateral type
    
    urn 16Fb96a5fa0427Af0C8F7cF1eB4870231c8154B6000000000000000000000000 Urn index
    
    ink 60.000000000000000000 Locked collateral (COL1)
    
    art 1.000000000000000000 Outstanding debt (Dai)
    
    printf: ‘58234907888888888888888889’: Numerical result out of range
    
    spot 0.000000009223372036854775807 Price with safety mat (USD)
    
    rate 1.000000000000000000000000000 COL1 DAI exchange rate
    
    fill 0 Collateralization Ratio (%)
    
    rap 0.000000000000000000 Accumulated stability fee (Dai)
    
    dai 1.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 Vat Dai
    
    gem 0.000000000000000000



----------

**3. Withdraw Dai and send it to your ETH personal account.**  
**Run:**
`$ mcd dai exit 1`

**Example Output:**

    vat 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 Vat balance
    
    ext 1.000000000000000000 ERC20 balance  

**Note:** When you want to pay back your debt and unlock your collateral, follow these steps again.  

----------
**4. Add your Dai back into the urn.**  
**Run:**
`$ mcd dai join 1`  

**Example Output:**
    vat 1.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 Vat balance
    
    ext 0.000000000000000000 ERC20 balance  

----------

**5. Remove your Dai debt and unlock your COL1 collateral from internal system (vat).**  

**Run:**

`$ mcd –-ilk=COL1-A frob -- -60 -1`

**Example Output:**

    ilk COL1-A Collateral type
    
    urn 16Fb96a5fa0427Af0C8F7cF1eB4870231c8154B6000000000000000000000000 Urn index
    
    ink 0.000000000000000000 Locked collateral (COL1)
    
    art 0.000000000000000000 Outstanding debt (Dai)
    
    printf: ‘58234907888888888888888889’: Numerical result out of range
    
    spot 0.000000009223372036854775807 Price with safety mat (USD)
    
    rate 1.000000000000000000000000000 COL1 DAI exchange rate
    
    fill 0 Collateralization Ratio (%)
    
    rap 0 Accumulated stability fee (Dai)
    
    dai 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 Vat Dai
    
    gem 60.000000000000000000 Unlocked collateral (COL1)  

----------

**6. Finally, remove your collateral COL1 token from the COL1 adapter.**  

**Run:**

`$ mcd –-ilk=COL1-A gem exit 60` 

**Example Output**

    vat 0.000000000000000000 Unlocked collateral (COL1)
    
    ink 0.000000000000000000 Locked collateral (COL1)
    
    ext 60.000000000000000000 External account balance (COL1)  

After running the above commands, please confirm that you have your initial collateral (COL1) back in your wallet.
