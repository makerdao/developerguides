## Problem and Solution

## Dai and CDP mechanisms

#### Economics
How does it keep its peg?

<img align="right" width="300" height="275" style="padding: 20px" src="./pictures/supplyDemand.png">

- Demand curve can shift due to market conditions, confidence of Dai holders, etc

- Supply curve is shifted through a permissionless credit factory on Ethereum

- Any actor can vary the supply of Dai through a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP)

- The system was built so that these actors are incentivized to shift the supply curve to ensure that the price is $1
