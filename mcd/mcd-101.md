## Problem and Solution
The ultimate guage of capital is denominated in the Global Currency, which is US Dollars (USD).

Is Bitcoin stable relative to the Global Currency?

**Problem**: No, bitcoin, ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies are not stable relative to the USD.

**Solution**: Dai

### MakerDAO's Flapship Product

Dai Stablecoin
* 1 Dai ~= 1 USD
* Basic user
* Fully backed by Collateral

## Dai and CDP mechanisms

### Economics

**How does it keep its peg?**

<img align="right" width="300" height="275" style="padding: 20px" src="./pictures/supplyDemand.png">

* Demand curve can shift due to market conditions, confidence of Dai holders, etc

* Supply curve is shifted through a permissionless credit factory on Ethereum

* Any actor can vary the supply of Dai through a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP)

* The system was built so that these actors are incentivized to shift the supply curve to ensure that the price is $1


<br/>
<br/>

### CDP

**Collateralized Debt Position (CDP)**


  * Borrow Dai through locking up cryptoassets as collateral

  * Repay Dai + fee to retrieve collateral

  * Safe, over-collateralized CDP >

**Analogous to a Mortgage**


* Bank gives you a loan by “locking” ownership rights with them

* Repay debt + interest to “free” the bank’s ownership of the house

**Liquidations**

1. CDP is automatically liquidated if the collateral value (in USD) falls too low

2. Part of the collateral is auctioned off to cover the outstanding debt + penalty fee

3. Dai is then burned to decrease the supply

  CDP owner receives the leftover collateral

### System Lines of Defense

At any point, the system must have more value in collateral than value of Dai supply. The following mechanisms help maintain system solvency:

1. **Supply and Demand** - supply and demand of CDPs (and thus Dai) is influenced by the Stability Fees and Debt Ceiling adjustments

2. **Liquidation** - any time the collateral value of a CDP gets closer to its debt, it becomes “risky-er”. The system liquidates CDPs that get too risky

3. **MKR Minting/Burning** - Incentivized to Govern prudently, MKR Holders are rewarded from MKR burning when Stability Fees are paid. However, if the DCS accrues too much bad debt, MKR is minted to cover the deficit.

4. **Emergency Shutdown** - This is a process that is used as a last resort in cases of extreme market irrationality, attacks, or coordinated upgrades. Emergency Shutdown gracefully settles the Maker Platform while ensuring that all users, both Dai holders and CDP users, receive the net value of assets they are entitled to.

<br/>

### Sai vs Dai

| Single Collateral Dai        |  Multi Collateral Dai |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Single collateral type backing Dai | Multi. collateral types backing Dai |
| Less diversified | Collateral can be many assets |
| Liquidations occur at a fixed discount to the current collateral price | Liquidations are handled using Auctions|
| MKR used to pay stability fee | Dai used to pay stability fee |
| Decentralized governance through MKR voting rights| Decentralized governance through MKR voting rights|
| ----- |  More diversified and stable |

<br/>

### Quick Vocabulary - General

**Risk Parameters** - system variables adjusted through MKR governance to control various types of risk.
Important parameters for each collateral type:
* **Stability fee** - a fee that continuously accrues on debt in a CDP (e.g. 0.5% per year)
* **Debt ceiling** - max amount of Dai minted for a given collateral type (e.g. 10 million Dai)
* **Liquidation ratio** - required amount of collateral as a proportion of a CDP’s total debt (e.g. 150%)

`ilk` - collateral type; each has their own set of risk parameters <br/>
`urn` - collateralized debt position; a CDP owner can control one urn per collateral type <br/>
`gem` - unlocked collateral; gem is collateral that is not yet locked in a CDP but still recorded in the system <br/>
`sin` - system debt unit; a debt token that is tracked during liquidation process <br/>
`dai` - stablecoin; a good debt token
<br/>

### Quick Vocabulary - Rates

* **Risk Premium Rate** - This rate is used to calculate the risk premium fee that accrues on debt in a CDP. A unique Risk Premium Rate is assigned to each collateral type.  (e.g. 2.5%/year for Collateral A, 3.5%/year for Collateral B, etc) <br/>
* **Base Rate** - This rate is used to calculate the base fee that accrues on debt in a CDP. A system wide Base Rate is assigned to all collateral types. (e.g. 0.5%/year for the Dai Credit System) <br/>
* **Stability Rate** = _Risk Premium Rate + Base Rate_. This rate is used to calculate the **Stability Fee**. <br/>
* **Savings Rate** - This rate is used to calculate the interest that accrues on Savings Dai. A system wide Savings Rate is assigned to all Savings Dai. (e.g. 1%/year for Savings Dai)

**All rates accrue regularly on a per second basis.**
<br/>


#### Motivations on Concise Jargon
<br/>
**To sidestep terminological debates** - for example, whether to say rate of target price change or target rate <br/>
**To decouple financial and technical vocabularies** - we can more flexibly improve one without affecting the other. <br/>
**To discuss the system formally** - this ability, with the financial interpretation partly suspended, has suggested insights that would have been harder to think of inside the normal language. <br/>
**To better formalize the implementation** - the precise and distinctive language makes the structure and logic of the implementation more apparent and easier to formalize. <br/>
**To decrease verbosity** - concise names make the code less verbose and the concepts easier to handle on paper, whiteboard, etc.

### Smart Contract Modules

#### Core Module
The core module contains the state of the Dai Credit System (DCS) and its central mechanisms while in normal operation.

Components - `Vat`, `Cat`, `Spotter`

What are the components?
* `Vat` - **The single source of truth for the Dai Credit System.** It contains the accounting system of the core CDP, Internal Dai balances, and collateral state. The Vat has no external dependencies and maintains the central "Accounting Invariants" of Dai. It houses the public interface for CDP management, allowing urn (cdp) owners to adjust their CDP state balances. It also contains the public interface for CDP fungibility, allowing urn (cdp) owners to transfer, split, and merge CDPs. Excluding these interfaces, the Vat is accessed through trusted smart contract modules.
* `Cat` - Public interface for **confiscating unsafe urns (cdps)** and processing seized collateral via their respective flip (collateral) auction.
* `Spotter` - Allows external actors to update the price feed in Vat for a given Ilk (collateral type).

Why do we have them?

* `Vat` - def. “a large tank or tub used to hold liquid”

  **The Vat holds the fundamental primitives of the Dai Credit System:**
  * Database - Risk parameters as well as Dai, Sin, collateral, and debt balances
  * Accounting System - Basic accounting operations to update the Database
  * CDP Management - Adjustment of locked collateral and debt position (Dai creation)
  * CDP Fungibility - Ability to transfer, split and merge CDPs

  The Vat and these primitives are designed to be non-upgradable or replaceable. <br/>
  Other components of the system, such as auctions, oracles, and rate accumulators, are subject to future development. Their business logic has been contained within their own smart contract modules as an upgradable interface between the user and the Vat. Since these subsystems have access to more complex operations within the Vat, module upgrades are voted in by MKR holders. Through CDP management/fungibility, direct access to the Vat provides a strong guarantee to users that the basic semantics/interface aren’t going to change. <br/>

* `Cat` - def. “A domesticated, carnivorous mammal”

  **The Cat “bites” CDPs that are too risky.** <br/>
  The minter of Dai is a CDP owner and the “borrower”, while the smart contract system is the “lender”. To increase the borrower’s confidence in the minted value lent out, the lender requires all minted Dai to be fully backed by an asset with value that is proven in free markets. If the value of the underlying asset dips below the required amount, the collateralization ratio (USD value of asset / USD value of Dai debt) decreases. To increase this ratio and prevent insolvency of the system, the lender takes (via Cat) the collateral and sells it for Dai in an auction (Flipper). <br/>
  Remember: 1 Dai must always be backed by more than 1 USD worth of assets. <br/>

* `Spotter` - def. “an aviator or aircraft employed in locating or observing enemy positions” <br/>

  The Dai Credit System requires real time information about the market price of the assets used as collateral in CDPs. Ultimately, this market price determines the amount of Dai that can be minted, as well as the grab condition for CDP liquidations. The oracle module handles how markets prices are recorded on the blockchain. <br/>

  The Spotter is simply **an interface contract** where external actors pull the **current market price** from the Oracle module for the **specified collateral type**. The Vat reads the market price from the spotter. <br/>
