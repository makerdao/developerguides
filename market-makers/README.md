# Market Makers

This document contains the necessary resources for partners to implement Keepers for Market Making.

## Prerequisites

This document assumes familiarity with Ethereum, and in-depth knowledge of the Maker platform.

## Market Maker Keeper repos

### [Market Maker Keeper](https://github.com/makerdao/market-maker-keeper)

This repository contains a set of Keepers that have been implemented to facilitate market making on a specific set of decentralized exchanges. While implemented specifically to work on the specified exchanges, they all share logic and operate similarly.

### [Market Maker Stats](https://github.com/makerdao/market-maker-stats)

Market Maker Stats provides a set of tools for visualizing market making data for a set of decentralized exchanges.

### [Pymaker](https://github.com/makerdao/pymaker)

Pymaker is a Python API which provides endpoints to interact with the Maker smart contracts. It exposes most of the functionality of the Maker platform, but most importantly for this guide it can be used to create Keepers. This library can be used to create custom market making Keepers.
