## Problem and Solution
The ultimate guage of capital is denominated in the Global Currency, which is US Dollars (USD).

Is Bitcoin stable relative to the Global Currency?

**Problem**: No, bitcoin, ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies are not stable relative to the USD.

**Solution**: Dai

### MakerDAO's Flapship Product

Dai Stablecoin
* 1 Dai ~= 1 USD
* Basic user
* Fully backed by Collateral

## Dai and CDP mechanisms

### Economics

**How does it keep its peg?**

<img align="right" width="300" height="275" style="padding: 20px" src="./pictures/supplyDemand.png">

* Demand curve can shift due to market conditions, confidence of Dai holders, etc

* Supply curve is shifted through a permissionless credit factory on Ethereum

* Any actor can vary the supply of Dai through a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP)

* The system was built so that these actors are incentivized to shift the supply curve to ensure that the price is $1


<br/>
<br/>

### CDP

**Collateralized Debt Position (CDP)**


  * Borrow Dai through locking up cryptoassets as collateral

  * Repay Dai + fee to retrieve collateral

  * Safe, over-collateralized CDP >

**Analogous to a Mortgage**


* Bank gives you a loan by “locking” ownership rights with them

* Repay debt + interest to “free” the bank’s ownership of the house

**Liquidations**

1. CDP is automatically liquidated if the collateral value (in USD) falls too low

2. Part of the collateral is auctioned off to cover the outstanding debt + penalty fee

3. Dai is then burned to decrease the supply

  CDP owner receives the leftover collateral
